<h1 align="center">Arduino Color Music Project</h1>

This project combines the power of Arduino, a microphone, and LED strips to create a captivating color music experience. By capturing audio data from the microphone, the Arduino board analyzes the sound and generates corresponding light patterns on the LED strips, resulting in an amazing visual representation of the music or sound being played.

## Features

- Captures audio data from a microphone
- Analyzes sound frequencies and amplitudes
- Generates dynamic and synchronized light patterns on LED strips
- Creates an immersive color music experience

## Hardware Requirements

To set up and run the Arduino Color Music project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- Microphone module or sensor
- LED strips (addressable or non-addressable)
- Power supply for the LED strips
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or prototyping board (if necessary)
- Optional: Amplifier for audio output

## Wiring Instructions

Connect the components according to the following wiring instructions:

1. Connect the microphone module or sensor to the Arduino board's analog input pin.
2. Connect the LED strips to the appropriate digital output pins on the Arduino board.
3. Connect the power supply to the LED strips and ensure it can provide sufficient power for the LEDs.
4. If using an amplifier for audio output, connect it to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board.

Refer to the specific datasheets and pinouts of your components for more detailed instructions on wiring.

## Installation

1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Install the Arduino IDE from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
3. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
4. Copy and paste the code provided in this repository
5. Modify the code as needed to match your specific hardware setup or customization preferences.
6. Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
7. Power on the LED strips and ensure they are properly connected and working.

## Usage

1. Start playing music or generating sound near the microphone.
2. The Arduino board will capture the audio data and analyze it.
3. The LED strips will display synchronized light patterns based on the analyzed audio data.
4. Experiment with different music or sounds to create unique visual effects.
5. Adjust the code parameters to modify the light patterns and customize the color music experience.

## Troubleshooting

- If the LED strips do not light up or display incorrect patterns, double-check the wiring connections and power supply.
- Ensure that the microphone module is properly connected to the Arduino board and functioning correctly.
- Verify that the Arduino board is properly recognized by the computer and that the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE.
- Check for any error messages or warnings displayed in the Arduino IDE during code upload or execution.
